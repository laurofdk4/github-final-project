# Simple Interest Calculator

A straightforward calculator that computes simple interest based on the principal, annual interest rate, and time period in years.

## How to Use

### Inputs:
- `p`: Principal amount
- `t`: Time period in years
- `r`: Annual interest rate

### Output:
- `Simple Interest = p * t * r`

## Example Usage

```python
# Python example
p = 1000  # Principal
t = 2     # Time in years
r = 0.05  # Annual interest rate

simple_interest = p * t * r
print(f"Simple Interest: {simple_interest}")
